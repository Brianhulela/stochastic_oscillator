![Cover Image](https://github.com/Brianhulela/stochastic_oscillator/blob/master/TSLA_stochastic_oscillator.png)

This repository contains a Python implementation of a trading strategy based on the Stochastic Oscillator, enhanced with trend filtering using a simple moving average (SMA). The strategy identifies potential buy and sell signals by analyzing momentum shifts (%K and %D crossovers) within the context of broader market trends. 

### Features
- Calculation of the Stochastic Oscillator (%K and %D).
- Integration of a trend filter using a 20-day SMA to reduce false signals.
- Backtesting framework to simulate trades and evaluate performance.
- Clear visualization of the oscillator, signals, and price trends.

### Learn More
For a detailed explanation of the strategy, check out the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@brianhulela/trading-strategies-stochastic-oscillator-f5c33509aeca).

### Getting Started
Clone this repository, install the required libraries and follow the provided Jupyter Notebook to calculate signals, backtest the strategy, and visualize results.
